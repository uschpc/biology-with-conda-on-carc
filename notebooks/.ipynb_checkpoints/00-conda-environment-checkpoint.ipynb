    "Conda is a package and environment manager primarily used for open-source data science packages for the Python and R programming languages. It also supports other programming languages like C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, Scala, Ruby, and Lua.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Commands from this notebook should be run in a terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Setting up conda is a one-time process. Consecutive use requires only purging any loaded modules and activating the conda environment.\n",

    "This module is based on the minimal Miniconda installer which includes the package and environment manager Conda that installs and updates packages and their dependencies. This module also provides Mamba, which is a drop-in replacement for most conda commands that enables faster package solving, downloading, and installing.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want a newer version of Conda or Mamba than what is available in the module, you can also install them into one of your directories. We recommend installing either [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Mambaforge](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).\n",
